# My very first Web Page

Welcome!

## Project stages

As we advance though the modules, my first website is being created.

### Stage 1

With basic HTML and CSS we have developed 3 pages all linked together.
The project is not responsive yet.

### Stage 2

We've learned to manage the files and back-up our work with the terminal and Github.
